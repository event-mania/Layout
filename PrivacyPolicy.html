    <h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>Like most website operators, Event Mania collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. Event Mania's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Event Mania's visitors use its website. From time to time, Event Mania
        may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in
        the usage of its website.</p>
    <p>Event Mania also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
        for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.EventMania.com blog posts. Event Mania only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
        personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

    <h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Certain visitors to Event Mania's websites choose to interact with Event Mania in ways that require Event Mania
        to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Event Mania gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at
        https://www.EventMania.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
        the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
        means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2>
    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
        cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
        compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
        other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
        Policy covers the use of cookies by Event Mania and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
        you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms
        of service of every site you visit.</p>
    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
        party sites, products or services.</p>

    <p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p>
    <h2 id="PIIProtection">6. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>Event Mania discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
        its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
        process it on Event Mania's behalf or to provide services available at Event Mania's website, and (ii) that have
        agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
        located outside of your home country; by using Event Mania's website, you consent to the transfer of such
        information to them. Event Mania will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
        organizations, as described above, Event Mania discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or
        when Event Mania believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or
        rights of Event Mania, third parties or the public at large.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of https://www.EventMania.com and have supplied your email address, Event Mania may
        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
        date with what's going on with Event Mania and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type
        of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via
        a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Event Mania takes all measures reasonably
        necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
